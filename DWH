Datawarehouse ~ Storage of Databases
DWH is built on top of DB, but its purpose is different 
Mostly used for Structured Data

================================== DWH Vs DB ============================================
DWH
- Store large volume of data
- Designed for read heavy operations 
- High latency
- Denormalized => Data Redundancy is more
- Columnar Storage => Parquet, ORC etc
- Parallel processing of requests
- OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
  => Teradata
  => Exadata
  => Snowflake 
  => Red-Shift

DB
- Stores small volume of data 
- Designed for write heavy operations 
- Low latency 
- Highly Normalized => Data Redundancy is less
- Row based 
- Not optimized for parallel processing
- OLTP (Online Transactional Processing)
  => MySQL
  => Oracle
  => Postgres

========================================== Rules of DWH ==================================
=> Integrated 
   - Multiple sources are integrated to a DWH to get data

=> Subject Oriented 
   - Reports can be genarated by analysing data in DWH

=> Time Variant
   - Historical Data 

=> Non-Volatile 
   - Data should not change at a point of time 

===================================== DWH Vs Data Lake ====================================
DL
- Can share infinitely large volume of data 
- Support Structured, Semi-Structured and Un-Structured data 
- Doesn't require pre-defined schema 
- ELT
- Cost is Cheaper
- Schema on read 

DWH
- Can share a limited storage
- Only supports Structured data and Semi-Structured data 
- Required pre-defined schema 
- ETL
- Higher Cost 
- Schema on write
